# Meeting Notes (16th August, 2021)

## Group 2

### Discussion on readings

* One thing that stands out about this movement is it being open to criticism and revise it's way of evaluating what causes are the most important
* In a way, it's always dealing with the challenge of explore-exploit tradeoff when the entire world state is not known which is true for most scenarios - strategies similar to the ones used in reinforcement learning, and strategies like iterative deepening search bring useful insights here
* The Pascal's mugging was particularly interesting and brought the point home about the flaws in expected value thinking in a nice way
* Triage is important but it's important to recognize the boundaries. A person will in most cases prefer to save the lives of their own family members over more number of strangers if it comes to that. It's important to account for these. Similar is the human vs animal conflict.
* The point about the risks associated with systemic change, and unintended consequences despite good intentions
* Might appear to outsiders like a "X group's movement" - Right now, it's around 10,000 members, which is still small
  * But as it grows, managing and updating values across the community becomes a challenge, and in absence of that, the entire movement can fall apart, or go off-rails.

### Privileged people's movement

* By design it's kind of that, since people can think about helping others only when their lives are liveable in the first place
* In countries where diversity is being specifically encouraged, movement like EA which sort of turns out to have most members from relatively privileged backgrounds might be opposed
* The causes EA focuses on, at times like in longtermism, there are additional constraints due to the issues being related to national security. So, for instance, if you want to work on Biosecurity, the research happens mostly in North America, but you can't get involved unless you're a US national. That leads to another set of limitations.
* Some people tend to have a utilitarian mindset or approach (this is universally good vs universally bad), and this if unchecked, can lead to factions, fascist mentality etc.
* If people who we are trying to help are not in the discussion, that's another problem, but it runs the risk of biased thinking since the poor person has special attachment to the particular cause affecting them, but at the same time, it's important to have equal representation, in the sense, not everyone is equal, but they have equal right to be heard. Also to avoid biased worldview of our own.
* Individuality should be respected, and keeping an open mind, being open to criticism, consistently re-evaluating your thoughts and actions is an important key message that shouldn't get lost in trying to do the most good.

### Focusing on symptoms than the causes

* Based on our discussions and our perception so far, EA movement seems to be focused more on treating the symptoms than finding the root cause and treating it.
  * On one end, this is potentially limiting and sub-optimal, at the same time, trying to go for the root cause runs atleast 2 risks:
    * You don't know if you'll ever be able to find it, so when do you actually take action becomes a problem
    * Your supposed root cause might not be the right one. And even if it is, it'll likely lead to a cascading effect and potentially unintended and highly undesirable outcomes (butterfly effect).
      * Can create more harm than good if our understanding is flawed - doctor's example - found root cause, removed part of brain, and as a result patient lost ability to create memories.
  * Focusing on a single objective function (doing the most good) can lead to religious kind of movement
    * What if a certain group identifies that killing a certain chunk of the population is better for the society overall. Even though so far, EA has maintained that it's about maximising good without causing harm, but the lines start to think when larger groups and more people are involved.
      * Examples:
        * Killing Hitler: Good or Bad? Turns out British avoided assassinating Hitler since he wasn't as competent as the other commanders who happened to be below him. If he was assassinated, we might have even more disastrous outcomes, maybe Germany even winning the war... who knows?
        * War is bad but fighting for your country is good etc.
    * Can lead to the same issues we can have with AI trying to optimize for an objective function we set, but due to this oversimplification, in doing so, we create disastrous outcomes.

### Possible issues with systemic changes

* [Beware systemic change](https://web.archive.org/web/20200424075657/https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/22/beware-systemic-change/) is an interesting read, and highlights key issues in going for systemic changes.
* At the same time, sometimes they are necessary (think abolition of slavery, or universal adult franchise, etc.)
* You don't know if these movements will be successful, but sometimes it's worth a shot since the rewards compensate
* In some situations, it might lead to things being worse off, so the possible adverse effects (2nd and 3rd order effects) should be taken into consideration as much as possible.

### Staying connected

* Relationships and collaborations we form within the EA community is super valuable in itself. Maintaining a database of the issues, the current interventions and gaps is another
