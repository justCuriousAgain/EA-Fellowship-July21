# Meeting Notes (19th July, 2021)

## Group 2

### Discussion on Readings

* Very well written but really difficult to read since we are complicit as consumers of the products created of someone's suffering
* How do you take into account livelihoods depending on this industry, and by reducing efficiency you might impact several livelihoods which might lead to other bigger consequences in absence of alternatives for these people
* Consumption of meat vs the source of it - the moral question
* People's behaviour sensitive to pricing. Synthetic meat options might help, if they become cheaper and easily available
* Example of COVID - in times of uncertainty/risk from animal products the consumption went so down that prices slashed to 1/10th of the regular prices
* If the animals are treated well while they were alive, does that still count as bad when killing them for food later?
* If the animals don't have a concept of time (past or future etc), but if throughout their life they are suffering, is it equally bad?
* Can the concept of suffering exist in isolation, without a concept of happiness or satisfaction or well being?
* Do we understand whether plants suffer? Also, what about algorithms and machines. With AI and ML advancements, these lines are thinning, just because we have a different hardware, does that mean machines don't have rights? etc.

### Triage when comparing human lives and lives of other animals

* Concept becomes extremely complex when including animals into the picture
  * Saying that saving/reducing suffering of animals is important is one thing but it's not at all easy to apply triage here
    * How do we weigh X human lives vs Y animal lives, or is that even the right question to ask?
    * When talking of deworming kids, what about the moral value of an insect/bug's life?
* Need to consider 2nd and 3rd order implications of our decisions
  * 1 human can go and save more animals, or 1 human can go and kill more animals
* How will they treat us if they were deciding about us?
* Do we understand enough to take a call? We have very clear uncertainities so definitely more research could be required in this area?
* How do you create alternatives for consumers of meat or people hunting? Implications on livelihoods of people who depend on this sector?

### Other thoughts

* Do animals have a conception of suffering
  * Suffering can be of different types - mental as well as psychological
* How will our values and decisions change if with new innovations like Neuralink animals start showing sentient behaviour
  * They have the hardware already, sometimes better than humans, and the machine can do the processing for them
* What about situations when you don't even have a concept of suffering. That is you don't even know you are Suffering
  * Take the example of North Korea. A lady who fled and survived mentioned she didn't know something like Freedom existed. How would you think about suffering for them
* Suicides and Euthanasia - Does any animal have the capacity to value or devalue their own life? For instance, do we know of any animals that at some point decides that it's no point living, and commits suicide
* Can we think of a better way to employ them other than food (eating dogs vs dogs as pets or sniffer dogs) that'd reduce their suffering and change their perception in society? But then what's to stop people from creating genetically modified variants that could be catastrophic.
* Can we explore scenarios where we can exist in synergy with other creatures instead of necessarily exploiting them in some way

### Letter to self Exercise

* Considerations about use of plastic
* Being open minded and inclusive (sometimes just hear them out, let them speak, you might discover something new)
* Dependency on the future state of the world. Other considerations will matter very less if the planet is burning. In that case, one would argue saving the planet is the most important thing to do, at times even disregarding moral obligations
