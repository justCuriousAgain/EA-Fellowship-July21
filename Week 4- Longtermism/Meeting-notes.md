# Meeting Notes (26th July, 2021)

## Group 2

### Discussion on readings

* Thinking about working on problems of the future somehow seems cooler to work on. Looking at the current problems doesn't create the same vibe - infact it's downer at times.
  * Take an example, people create movies about dystopian futures and apocalyptic scenarios, which are fun to watch, but we don't have action movies depicting kids dying from hunger
* How to be human in the age of the machine - The future doesn't just happen. We create it. If that isn't true, then there's nothing we can really do then, and any discussion we have doesn't really make any difference.

### Exercise 1 - Allowing X people to die now to save Y in the future

* Is it a time bomb? If it is, do we really have any control?
* If it isn't, then these kinds of scenarios have always kept happening. Think of war heroes, or people walking into disasters. Should we be saving those? Well the costs are much higher if the disaster is not controlled. But the order of time matters a lot here. Not in the 200 years to 2000 years etc scale, but whether we're talking of decades in the future or centuries into the future. It'd probably we wise to just hope people in the future are aware of it, and have enough time to build solutions to evade it.

### Exercise 2 - Bringing sight to X people or allow couples to have kids and have better futures

* Here we're talking about humans who haven't yet born - What about the costs of raising the children, also if we did nothing they don't get born. Is that really bad? What's the real value in having more humans?
  * There's value in increasing our chances that humanity keeps existing, because of our potential (probably), but is there any marginal value in having more humans in the now?
* If we're thinking the potential value of a future human when taking into account whether they should be born or not, we can't disregard that when saving values in the now, which again raises the question - Are all lives equal? Are all lives worth saving? When do you make that decision and when you don't?
* Also, need to consider the quality of life we're improving - investing in education, health outcomes etc and create an open and inclusive society.
* Simplifying helps in making sense of things, but we need to be cautious not to base our decisions just on that simplification

### Question: Are future generations being discriminated against

* Discrimination is probably not the right word, since discrimination would be if we're not allowing their say. The situation here is that they are not saying anything, and hence it can't be called discrimination. On top of that, we can't assume we know their interests. The important thing is to allow them to build their own moral values, and build their own institutions.
  * Ref. from the book - When breath becomes air - "Not only protected my identity, she protected my ability to forge a new one". In that spirit, we need to allow them to have their own interests and moral values.
* Future generations will have their own moral values. Making solutions for them is similar to forcing your mindset on someone else.
* How we create institutions, technologies etc. shapes the values and social structures we're allowing to be built around those.
