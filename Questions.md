# Questions

* Can we really say all lives are equal? For instance, if one person is the PM of a country, while the other is an ordinary citizen, and we can save only one. Shouldn't the 2nd order effects of the PM dying be taken into account?

* In terms of the actions we take, is it creating a flywheel? Like a data flywheel in the Machine Learning domain

* How would someone who's donated know what happened of their money? Blockchain solutions? Smart contracts?

* How do we determine who to trust?

* If we're treating this equivalent to how we invest in stocks, then we also should take into account that stock prices are highly speculative in nature, and the kind of shady malpractices that occur in the corporate world

* Cost per life saved is a bit shady to me. How does it work? Do people in healthcare really calculate this way? Also, it certainly seems like a reasonable tool, but the calculation is oversimplified. Find some counter examples.

* Not too impressed with the comparison between the Ukrainian man who lobbied for eradication of Smallpox vs the guy who actually led the movement and made it happen. People are not watermelons. It's kind of saying that you can make anyone a CEO, doesn't make a difference. A simple counterexample is see Steve Jobs with Apple and John Sculley. The argument is invalid, but I get the motive and basic idea. Also, if you understand the butterfly effect, you could well understand how it's flawed to assume you can answer "What would have happened otherwise"? A single shot caused the first World War. You can't really know what would happen otherwise. Can you really say if the person hadn't resisted the urge to fire the nuclear missile, what would have happened? Probably a nuclear war?

* Also, when you're computing the lives saved by a doctor this way, why don't you just go to any random doctor. The idea is not every doctor is equally good
