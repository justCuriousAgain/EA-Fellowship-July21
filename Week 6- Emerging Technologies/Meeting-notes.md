# Meeting Notes (9th August, 2021)

## Group 2

### Discussion on readings

### AI

* Intersection of AI and Bio-engineering
* The future doesn't just happen, we create it.
* Moral lock-in (whatever values were assigned to AI when it takes off, will probably govern how humans will live for the foreseeable future). A historical example could be the American constitution, or infact many other constitutions which got some principles/safeguards added in which might have been appropriate at the time the constitution was framed, but got locked in and the society is still facing implications of it.
* Lack of say of the less influential countries and other stakeholders involved
  * Caveat - Different people have different motives and causes that appeal to them (we're attracted and influenced by single person stories than larger statistics - texting while driving vs terrorist attack on a plane)
  * It may be better to have the experts decide, and greater discussion is required on that front
* Are kids involved in the discussion, because they are going to be heavily impacted by the AI systems, and it can catastrophic if they don't get a say
* Need to have more centralization and standardization on AI development (right now even within countries this work, research and departments are scattered, so we need a greater collaboration). Also, collaboration with China is important so that the whole world develops in sync and that'd hopefully give time to the human society to adapt
* AI also raises questions about our own value systems and the ambiguity there. It'd likely help us better understand ourselves.
* AI on the edge (harware based AI) can help decentralize the risks by staying away from internet. It's hard but it shows some promise by avoiding single points of failure.
* Teenager on drugs analogy - Human society with AI is like a teenager who just discovered drugs. It can be used to cure some pains if used wisely, but has the potential to make the teen disfunctional or even kill, if not checked.

### Bio-engineering

* Takes about a month to develop a pathogen (it's not that hard)
* Leakages are scary, and we need to have robust systems in place to detect them early on
* Can't stop research since this same research has helped us fight pandemics as well
* Can take example of Sweden where the health department operates independently of the parliament. So, the experts can take the call not influenced by political motives or incentives

### Others

* Synthetic meat revolution, customized meat based on tastebuds etc.
* Environmental + biological risk: What if potentially harmful chemicals/pathogens leak into air which impact our reproductive ability etc, or have long term effects which don't get observed until very late
* 80,000 hours podcast
