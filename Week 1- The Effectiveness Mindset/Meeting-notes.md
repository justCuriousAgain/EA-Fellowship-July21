# Meeting Notes (5th July, 2021)

## Group 2

### Icebreaker game

* Would you rather:
  * Live for 12 months, or 14 months without screens?
  * Be able to stay fresh sleeping only 2 hours a day, or prefer perfect memory?
  
### Most interesting insight from the readings

* Scope Insensitivity
  * Just being aware of our limitations when large numbers are involved, can be helpful in detaching emotion attached.
  * Going with the gut feeling is not the best thing, and we should atleast do the math

### Important factors to consider when deciding which problems to attack

* Scale of the problem
* Is this area neglected
* Is this tractable

### Trade-offs

* You have 100k USD, and you have two charities, one which saves lives for 15k USD, and another that saves for 20k USD. How would you distribute the donation?
* Depends on multiple factors:
  * The scale of the problem they're addressing.
  * What if everyone chooses the same charity, the marginal benefit goes down
  * Is there a way that by investing dollars now, we can reduce this cost in the future (eg. investing in research) by creating the flywheel effect
* If all of these things are taken care of, would like to donate all the amount to the one which does this for a lower cost.

### Triage

* Should we be cold and calculating when the issue involved is saving lives? - variation of the trolley problem
  * It's important to do these calculations because if you don't you're probably doing much bigger damage
    * Say a doctor makes the call on who to save based on his/her gut feeling, this effectively creates a precedent for other juniors on how to act in a crucial situation, and if everyone just starts acting on their gut feeling, it can potentially cripple the entire healthcare system
  * But this calculation should also take into account 2nd order effects. For instance, if you let the sole breadwinner of a family die, to save another person, the whole family might end up in poverty.
  * Also, at times, you need to keep emotions into account as well. For instance, if an action of yours leads yourself into mental health issues later, then that's a bigger cost. If you're not well yourself, you might do more harm than good to others.

### Is this area neglected? Is this relevant?

* We should understand first why is this neglected?
  * Intractability?
  * High costs?
  * Not cool enough?
  * Communication barriers? Do we understand the problem well? - Example - PlayPump. They went so long without understanding if they were solving the right problem?
* Assuming these factors have been taken care of, there are atleast 2 reasons why it's a good idea to go for neglected problems:
  * Margin value addition is higher
  * We can spend some time exploring the space of potential solutions, understanding the problem better, instead of jumping to the first solution that comes to sight
