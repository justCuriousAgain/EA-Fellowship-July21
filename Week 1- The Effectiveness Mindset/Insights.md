## Ideas

### Scope Insensitivity

* We're terrible at making sense of really large numbers. A simple example is, even though we understand that billion is much larger than say a million, we don't feel the magnitude of that, coz of the way our brains are wired. We feel both are just vaguely very large numbers. So, our intuition is really bad at making decisions when really large numbers are involved.

* Courage is not about being fearless. It's about being afraid and doing the right thing anyway.
