# Meeting Notes (23rd August, 2021)

## Group 2

### Career paths

* AI Safety, application of AI to help fix global issues
* Using existing career capital, privilege, and access to find the most effective ways to contribute.
* Knowing that more things are wrong with the world is kind of everwhelming, but this fellowship has introduced to frameworks, people and community that helps make sense of these issues and take action
* 1-on-1 career advice from 80,000 hours can be helpful
* Staying connected, the community is valuable enough in itself
* There are certain issues which you can't even get to because of multiple administrative, bureaucratic and nationality based barriers. So, instead of fighting your way to get there, you might be better off tackling issues which you have higher accessibility and resourcefulness in, and introducing EA ideas and community can be powerful in itself
